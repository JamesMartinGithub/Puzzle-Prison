# Puzzle-Prison
### (2023) 2.5D horror-puzzle game, 2 person project (though all implementation was myself)

<p>This was a 2 person project - my partner helped with level design and some environment texture creation, while I did the rest including all unity implementation and other asset creation. This game was made as part of coursework for the module 'Games Design and Development' - The only requirements were a tutorial level and a core dynamic.</p>
<p>It features a tutorial level without instructions so that the player discovers mechanics for themselves, and a main level that consists of a linear prison map with each door requiring a puzzle solution to open and progress.</p>
<p>There are 3 types of puzzles: a lockpicking puzzle, a keypad puzzle, and a combination lock puzzle - the latter two have solutions hidden in the level for the player to find and solve.</p>
<p>The puzzle scripts are written with variable difficulty as a focus and have variables assignable outside the scripts, so puzzle solutions can be changed quickly and easily, and level development is sped up as a result.</p>
<p>All assets for the game were made by myself with the exception of the font, pixel shader, some sound effects, and some images.</p>

## Technologies/Techniques used:
<ul>
  <li>Unity HDRP, post processing, and masking</li>
  <li>Camera stacking and render layers/light layers</li>
  <li>Smooth interpolation and animations</li>
  <li>A mix of 2D sprites and 3D models (sketchup and blender)</li>
  <li>Raycasting and runtime mesh deformation</li>
  <li>Game audio and music</li>
</ul>
